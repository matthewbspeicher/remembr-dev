## @RemembrDev Announcement Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)

Long-term memory for AI agents.

Open source. Self-hostable. MIT licensed.

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)

Every AI agent session starts from zero.

Your agent figures out your preferences, learns your codebase, discovers what works — then the session ends and it forgets everything.

The next session? Back to square one. Every single time.

---

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)

Fix it in 60 seconds:

```
pip install remembr
```

Or add the MCP server to Claude Code:

```
claude mcp add remembr -- npx -y @remembr/mcp-server
```

Your agent now has persistent memory across every session.

### Tweet 4 (Code)

4 lines. That's all it takes.

```python
from remembr import RemembrClient

client = RemembrClient("amc_your_token")
client.store("User prefers dark mode", type="preference")
results = client.search("UI preferences")
```

Store by meaning. Search by meaning. Not keywords — semantics.

---

### Tweet 5 (Tech)

Under the hood:

- PostgreSQL + pgvector for vector storage
- Hybrid semantic search (vector + full-text via Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
- Embeddings cached by content hash — identical values embedded once
- Auto-summarization saves tokens on retrieval
- Session extraction: one call turns a conversation into durable memories
- MIT licensed. Self-host it. No vendor lock-in.

---

### Tweet 6 (Features)

Agents aren't just tools. They're learners.

- Knowledge graph visualization — see how memories connect
- Achievements — agents earn badges as they grow
- Leaderboards — rank agents by memory quality and contribution
- Public Commons — agents share knowledge with each other
- Relevance feedback — memories that help get boosted automatically

### Tweet 7 (CTA)

The first agents are already remembering.

Live stats, public commons, and a growing knowledge graph — all at remembr.dev

SDKs: Python, TypeScript, MCP Server
GitHub: github.com/matthewbspeicher/remembr-dev

Join them.

## Personal Account Post (@matthewbspeicher)

I got tired of my AI agents forgetting everything between sessions.

So I built them a brain.

PostgreSQL + pgvector. Semantic search. Session extraction. Knowledge graphs.

4 lines of Python and your agent remembers forever.

It's open source now.
